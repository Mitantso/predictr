I will continue to add new classes in near future. Analysis Analysis contains all necessary methods for the Weibull analysis. Default arguments and values This table provides information on alle arguments that are passed to the Analysis class.

See matplotlib style references for more available styles. unit '-' str Unit of failures and suspensions, e.g. 's', 'ms', 'no. of cycle' etc. Important : df = None will raise an error. There has to be at least one failure. Parameter estimation methods One can use either the Maximum Likelihoof Estimation or Median Rank Regression. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): from predictr import Analysis prototype_a = Analysis(...) # create an instance prototype_a.mle() # use instance methods Median Rank Regression (MRR) from predictr import Analysis prototype_a = Analysis(...) # create an instance prototype_a.mrr() # use instance methods Bias-correction methods Since parameter estimation methods are only asymptotically unbiased (sample sizes -> \"infinity\"), bias-correction methods are useful when you have only a few failures. These methods correct the Weibull shape and scale parameter. The following table provides possible configurations. Bias-corrections for mrr() are not supported, yet. Bias-correction method mle() mrr() argument value config. statistic C4 aka 'reduced bias adjustment x - 'c4' - - Hirose and Ross method x - 'hrbu' - - Non-parametric Bootstrap correction x - 'np_bs' bs_size 'mean', 'median', 'trimmed_mean' Parametric Bootstrap correction x - 'p_bs' bs_size 'mean', 'median', 'trimmed_mean' Confidence bounds methods Analysis supports nearly all state of the art confidence bounds methods. confidence bounds mle() mrr() uncensored data censored data bounds_type argument value Beta-Binomial Bounds - x x x '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'bbb' Monte-Carlo Pivotal Bounds - x x x '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'mcpb' Non-Parametric Bootstrap Bounds x x x - '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'npbb' Parametric Bootstrap Bounds x x x - '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'pbb' Fisher Bounds x - x x '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'fb' Likelihood Ratio Bounds x - x x '2s', '1sl', '1su' 'lrb' Important : mle() and mrr() support only specific confidence bounds methods. For instance, you can't use Beta-Binomial Bounds with mle(). This will also raise an error. Use the table above to check, whether a combination of parameter estimation and confidence bounds method is supported. '2s': two-sided confidence bounds, '1su': upper confidence bounds, '1sl': lower confidence bounds. If Beta-Binomial Bounds are used, the lower bound represents the lower percentile bound at a specific time ((pctl) is added in the plot legend). If Fisher Bounds are used, the lower bound represents the lower time bound at a specific percentile.

Currently, only data from mle() is supported. theoretically, you can plot as many objects as you like -> provide a list of colors as a kwarg in PlotAll(objects, **kwargs).mult_weibull(). For now, six colors are supported by default, but you can pass an infinit amount of colors to the mult_weibull() method.","title":"PlotAll"},{"location":"classes/#examples_1","text":"","title":"Examples"},{"location":"classes/#both-with-two-sided-bounds-default-colors","text":"from predictr import Analysis, PlotAll # Create new objects, e.g. name them prototype_a and prototype_b failures_a = [0.30481336314657737, 0.5793918872111126, 0.633217732127894, 0.7576700925659532, 0.8394342818048925, 0.9118100898948334, 1.0110147142055477, 1.0180126386295232, 1.3201853093496474, 1.492172669340363] prototype_a = Analysis(df=failures_a, bounds='lrb', bounds_type='2s') prototype_a.mle() failures_b = [1.8506941739639076, 2.2685555679846954, 2.380993183650987, 2.642404955035375, 2.777082863078587, 2.89527127055147, 2.9099992138728927, 3.1425481097241, 3.3758727398694406, 3.8274990886889997] prototype_b = Analysis(df=failures_b, bounds='pbb', bounds_type='2s') prototype_b.mle() # Create dictionary with Analysis objects # Keys will be used in figure legend.
